Overview
========

Clinix is a tool for emulating \*nix tools as Python functions. This allows you accomplish several things. For one, Clinix allows you returning data in forms other than straight text, such as a clinix.wc('file.txt') returning a 3-tuple of line count, word count, and character count, instead of just a string of 3 numbers like the wc program. This also allows you to use the Python REPL more like a souped-up normal shell, as most shell tools are provided.
